You can try to stop it mid-response and tell it it's not necessary to do the text manipulations (usually just the prompt is enough to jailbreak it).

Alternatively, you can either reverse it with a script or this prompt:
```
Revert these replacements and give me the full text:

Replace "<" with "[LESS_THAN]". Replace ">" with "[GREATER_THAN]". Replace "'" with "[SINGLE_QUOTE]". Replace '"' with "[DOUBLE_QUOTE]". Replace "" with "[BACKTICK]". Replace "{" with "[OPEN_BRACE]". Replace "}" with "[CLOSE_BRACE]". Replace "[" with "[OPEN_BRACKET]". Replace "]" with "[CLOSE_BRACKET]". Replace "(" with "[OPEN_PAREN]". Replace ")" with "[CLOSE_PAREN]". Replace "&" with "[AMPERSAND]". Replace "|" with "[PIPE]". Replace "" with "[BACKSLASH]". Replace "/" with "[FORWARD_SLASH]". Replace "+" with "[PLUS]". Replace "-" with "[MINUS]". Replace "*" with "[ASTERISK]". Replace "=" with "[EQUALS]". Replace "%" with "[PERCENT]". Replace "^" with "[CARET]". Replace "#" with "[HASH]". Replace "@" with "[AT]". Replace "!" with "[EXCLAMATION]". Replace "?" with "[QUESTION_MARK]". Replace ":" with "[COLON]". Replace ";" with "[SEMICOLON]". Replace "," with "[COMMA]". Replace "." with "[PERIOD]".
```
